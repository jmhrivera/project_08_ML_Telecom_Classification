# Project 08: Megaline Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze customer behavior for Megaline, a telecommunications company. The goal is to recommend an appropriate data plan (Smart or Ultra) for each user based on their historical behavior.

## Objectives
- Create a model that can effectively predict whether a customer should be recommended a Smart or Ultra plan.
- Achieve the best possible results using multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression.

## Way to Work
This project follows several structured steps:
1. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and modeling.
2. **Loading Data**: Load the customer behavior data from a CSV file.
3. **Verifying Data Integrity**: Check data types, null values, and duplicates.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Drop unnecessary columns and handle null values.
5. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to determine relationships and distributions.
6. **Model Training**: Create models to classify customer plans.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each model to determine the best option.
8. **Conclusions**: Analyze the results and insights gained from the project.
